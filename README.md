Experiments with MLB statcast data

# Hypothesis testing for humans - Do the umps really want to go home early?

A/B tests for whether umps are calling pitches to end the game in extra innnings. See the [blog post](https://dantegates.github.io/2018/09/17/hypothesis-testing-for-humans-do-the-umps-really-want-to-go-home.html).
